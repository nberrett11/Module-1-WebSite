      <h3> My Background </h3>
      
      <p class="p1"> 
          I was born and raised in Arizona. Shortly after high school I started in the HVAC industry and                
          eventually worked my way up into the building automation aspect of the HVAC industry.
          About twelve years ago my Wife and I and our two children (at the time) moved here to North Carolina.
          When I'm not working I like to spend time with my family and enjoy the outdoors.
          I love to fly fish, especially when I'm able to do so with my son.
      </p>
      
	  <h4> My Future </h4> 
	  
      <p class="p2"> 
          Within the next four years I aim to earn a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science.
          With this degree I will be better qualified to move into a software engineering role and eventually a product manger role within my company.
          I will be engineering and eventually managing the product development process for products specific to the          building automation industry.

      <h3> Experience With Web Design</h3>
      
      <p class="p1"> 
          My experience with web design is limited to classroom settings only, although I have edited HTML code and published wbe pages for devices within the building automation industry. While this is just my second class i n web design I have learned a lot so far.</p>
      
	  <h4> Hopes for this course </h4> 
	  
      <p class="p2"> 
          Now that this course has begun and I have a better idea what it covers I hope to gain more experience working with GIT and collaborating in a software development/coding team enviornment.</p>
      
        <h4> My future in Web Design </h4> 
	  
      <p class="p3"> 
          I hope to eventually learn and focus more on back-end web design and use those skills along with prograaming skills to become a software engineer.</p>
